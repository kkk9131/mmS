# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このspecは、Mamapaceアプリケーションの開発ロードマップ「フェーズ1.1-A: API基盤構築」の最初のタスクとして、HTTPクライアント設定を実装します。安全で再利用可能なAPI通信基盤を構築し、モックからAPIへの段階的移行を可能にします。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured HTTP client, so that I can make API requests consistently across the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the HTTP client SHALL be initialized with base configuration
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the client SHALL use the configured base URL and headers
3. WHEN a request times out THEN the client SHALL handle it gracefully with a 10-second timeout
4. IF the request is successful THEN the client SHALL return the response data
5. IF the request fails THEN the client SHALL return a structured error object

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want request and response interceptors, so that I can handle authentication and logging consistently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any API request THEN the request interceptor SHALL automatically add authentication headers if available
2. WHEN receiving any API response THEN the response interceptor SHALL log the response in development mode
3. WHEN receiving an error response THEN the interceptor SHALL transform it into a consistent error format
4. IF the authentication token is expired THEN the interceptor SHALL attempt to refresh the token
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN all requests and responses SHALL be logged with timestamps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a feature flag system, so that I can switch between mock data and real API calls during development

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feature flag USE_API is false THEN the client SHALL return mock data instead of making real API calls
2. WHEN the feature flag USE_API is true THEN the client SHALL make real API requests
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the default SHALL be to use mock data
4. WHEN in production mode THEN the client SHALL always use real API calls
5. IF the feature flag changes THEN the client behavior SHALL update without requiring app restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that network issues are handled gracefully

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the client SHALL return a standardized error object with type 'network'
2. WHEN an HTTP error occurs THEN the client SHALL return an error object with the status code and message
3. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the client SHALL return an error object with type 'timeout'
4. IF the server returns a 401 error THEN the client SHALL trigger authentication refresh
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the error SHALL be logged in development mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want connection testing functionality, so that I can verify API connectivity

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connection test is called THEN it SHALL make a simple GET request to a health endpoint
2. IF the connection test succeeds THEN it SHALL return success status with response time
3. IF the connection test fails THEN it SHALL return failure status with error details
4. WHEN testing connection THEN it SHALL respect the current feature flag settings
5. IF using mock mode THEN the connection test SHALL return a simulated successful response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript type safety, so that API responses are properly typed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the response SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the error object SHALL have a consistent TypeScript interface
3. WHEN using the HTTP client THEN all methods SHALL have proper type definitions
4. IF the API response doesn't match the expected type THEN the client SHALL handle it gracefully
5. WHEN importing the HTTP client THEN all types SHALL be available for use in other modules
