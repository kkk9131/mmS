# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete authentication system for the Mamapace app, enabling secure user login using maternal health book numbers and nicknames. The system will provide JWT-based authentication with secure token management, automatic token refresh, and proper error handling for all authentication-related operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mother using the app, I want to log in securely using my maternal health book number and nickname, so that I can access personalized content and maintain my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid maternal health book number and nickname THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to the app
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and prevent access
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store a secure JWT token for subsequent API calls
4. WHEN the user closes and reopens the app THEN the system SHALL automatically log them in if a valid token exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mother, I want my authentication session to be secure and automatically managed, so that I don't have to worry about security or frequent re-logins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JWT token is received THEN the system SHALL store it securely using encrypted storage
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL automatically include the authentication token in request headers
3. WHEN a token is near expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it without user intervention
4. WHEN a token expires or becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mother, I want clear feedback during the login process, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator and disable the login button
2. WHEN login fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a network error message with retry option
3. WHEN login fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message
4. WHEN login succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and navigate to the main app

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mother, I want to be able to log out securely, so that my account remains protected when I'm not using the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to log out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored authentication tokens
2. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login screen
3. WHEN logout occurs THEN the system SHALL clear any cached user data
4. WHEN the app is uninstalled and reinstalled THEN the system SHALL require fresh authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be maintainable and testable, so that we can ensure reliability and add features safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL use feature flags to switch between mock and real API
2. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information in development mode
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations for all authentication flows
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL emit events that can be tested and monitored
